;PROSEDUR PENGGUNAAN
;SECARA DEFAULT TAMPILAN LCD AKAN MENAMPILKAN JAM DAN TANGGAL
;UNTUK MELAKUKAN PENGATURAN WAKTU NYALA/MATI SETIAP BEBAN DAPAT MENEKAN TOMBOL PUSHBUTTON
;SETELAH TOMBOL DITEKAN ANDA AKAN DIMINTA UNTUK MEMASUKKAN WAKTU ON DAN WAKTU OFF MELALUI KEYPAD
;PADA SAAT DI LCD MUNCUL TULISAN TIMER ON KETIK JAM YANG AKAN DIMASUKKAN KE SETTINGAN
;FORMAT DATA YANG DIMASUKKAN ADALAH SEBAGAI BERIKUT
;CONTOH :
;08*15
;KEMUDIAN DIAKHIRI DENGAN MENEKAN #
;FORMAT JAM ADALAH 24 JAM
;SETINGAN JAM AKAN OTOMATIS DIMASUKKAN KE EEPROM
;ANDA BISA MELIHAT SETTINGAN NYALA/MATI SETIAP BEBAN DENGAN MENEKAN HURUF 'A' 'B' 'C' ATAU 'D' PADA KEYPAD, PADA SAAT LCD MENAMPILKAN JAM DAN TANGGAL
